# Contributing to React Practice

First off, thank you for considering contributing to React Practice. It's people like you that make React Practice such a great tool.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GauravPatil29/react-practice.git
cd react-practice
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GauravPatil29/react-practice.git
```

If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

## Making Changes

Create a branch for your edits:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use one branch per fix/feature.

## Committing and Pushing Changes

Commit your changes in logical chunks. Use Git's interactive rebase feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
